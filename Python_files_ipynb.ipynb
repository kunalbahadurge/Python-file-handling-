        "\n",
        "    2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "    = Exception handling is a mechanism to manage runtime errors. It prevents the program from crashing and allows execution to continue safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "    = The finally block always executes, whether an error occurs or not. It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. What is logging in Python\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "    = import loads the entire module, while from module import x loads only specific components. The second method is used for cleaner and shorter code.\n",

        "\n",
        "    7.  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",

        "    9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",

        "\n",
        "    12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",

        "    17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",

        "    19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
